  <h2>Welcome to BarBack</h2>
  <p class="homep">What we hope will soon be the go to place for all things cocktails. Here you can find the anatomy of a cocktail, plenty of cocktail recipes for classic cocktails as well as ones created by the community, and the ability for you to create your own cocktail.</p>
  <p class="homep">The goal of BarBack is to make cocktails and liquor in general more accessable. No, we don't mean easier to get your hands on. We want to make it less of a taboo subject, and more of an occasion. Grab some friends and have a cocktail making party, discover what kind of cocktail is for you. Sweet? Strong? Whiskey? Tequila? There are countless mixes and blends you can try. It doesn't, and shouldn't, lead to bad decisions that turn into even worse consequences.</p>
  <p class="homep">Pease enjoy your cocktails responsibly</p>
